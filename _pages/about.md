Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at UNC Chapel Hill.   

My research interests lie at the intersection of optics, perception, graphics, optimization, and machine learning. I am a Senior Member of Optica, recipient of IEEE VR Best Dissertation Award, Timothy L. Quigg Inventor of the Year at UNC, and several Best Paper and Demo Awards. I completed my postdoctoral research at Princeton University, obtained my PhD from UNC Chapel Hill, and my B.Tech and M.Tech degrees in electrical engineering, with a specialization in Signal Processing, all from IIT Madras. I have previously held research internship positions at Facebook Reality Labs, Microsoft Research Cambridge, NVIDIA Research and I was also a visiting researcher at the Fluid Interfaces Group of MIT Media Lab and CoSMIC lab of NUS, Singapore.
